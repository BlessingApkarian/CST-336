                To smoothly transition between the stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity instance holds six, very important callbacks:
                <ul>
                    <li>.onCreate()</li>
                    <li>.onDestroy()</li>
                    <li>.onStart()</li>
                    <li>.onStop()</li>
                    <li>.onPause()</li>
                    <li>.onResume()</li>
                </ul>
                
                The concept map shows us every possible path the user could take while using an app.
                If the user opens more than one app, the app they start using uses .onCreate() method and starts 
                up while the app they had previously open, but did not cancel, goes into the .onPause() method.
                If the user cancels either app it will activate .onDestroy(). However, they can bounce between as many apps implementing these
                callbacks without any consequences. 
                <br /> 
                Get more  information on callback methods in the "<a href="callback.html">Callbacks</a>" page.
