                When a user is running an app, there are three navigations they can make:
                <ul>
                    <li>enter the app</li>
                    <li>through the app</li>
                    <li>exit the app</li>
                </ul>
                While navigating the app, the user triggers the lifecycles. Lifecycles are moved through by Activity classes (or instances).
                Each navigation listed above can allude to three stages of an Activity instance: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Activity Launched</li>
                    <li>Activity Running</li>
                    <li>Activity Shut Down</li>
                </ul>
                There are a set of six callbacks that Activities provide mentioned in the "<a href="concepts.html">Concepts</a>" page. 
                To summerize, when a user opens an app there are three callbacks activated before the app begins running. 
                Once the app is running, it is using some amount of memory. If many apps are open on a device, this could lead to a 
                heaping amount of memory useage. To prevent issues, there is a callback for pausing this usage while an app is 
                hanging out it the background. Only if the app is in use, with some exceptions, is it using memory. 
                There are two callbacks that are on stand-by and depending on the users actions, each one is called.
                When the user closes the app, the app dismantles the memory used.
                <br />
                For example, good implementation of the lifecycle callbacks can help ensure that your app avoids:
                <ul>
                    <li>Crashing if the user receives a phone call or switches to another app while using your app.</li>
                    <li>Consuming valuable system resources when the user is not actively using it.</li>
                    <li>Losing the user's progress if they leave your app and return to it at a later time.</li>
                    <li>Crashing or losing the user's progress when the screen rotates between landscape and portrait orientation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div> 
        </main>
