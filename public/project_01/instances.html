                Sometimes your activity enters destroyed due to normal app behavior, 
                such as when the user presses the Back button or your activity signals its own destruction. 
                In these scenarios, the user's expectation matches the system's behavior and you do not have any extra work to do.
                <br /><br />
                If something causes the app to crash, the system remebers the activity existed 
                even though the activity instance is gone. Once the user navigated back to the activity
                the system creates a new instance with the details of the activity before it was destroyed.
                <br /><br />
                This saved data is called the <i>instance state</i>. The instance state is a collection of "key-value pairs"
                stored in a Bundel object. This saves the info in each view, such as a text value entered in a EditText box.
                Threrefore, no extra coding is required to save user data.
